#Kickstart campaign analysis

##Project Overview

###Purpose

The purpose of this project is to find out how well did the campaigns for Louise's play "FEVER" fare in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals based on a range of campaign related inputs. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

From the data-based chart it appears that May was the month with the most successful Kickstarter campaigns, closely followed by June.The chart generally shows a bell-shaped trend in the success rate of campaign launches through January to December. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched, showing a pattern that might be worth investigating for. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The goal-based campaign outcome shows a 60%+ success rate in the range of 0-5000 dollars and 35000-42000 dollars. Between 15000 and 35000 dollars the success rate dropped from 50% to 20% then back to around 50% again. Hence if campaign goals are set either between 0 and 15000 dollars, or between 35000 and 42000 dollars will likely receive the best outcome. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

It was easy to make mistakes when writing countifs codes with multiple conditions, especially when selecting data from a particular source sheet. 

Also when using pivot table, selecting the right data to show in the analytic matrix can be challenging, as one needs to understand thoroughly the relationships between the inputs and what goals one wishes to achieve. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date? 

1.May was the month with the most successful Kickstarter campaign across around 20 countries.

2.January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Campaign goals are likely to receive the best outcomes if set either between below 1000 and 15000 dollars, or between 35000 and 42000 dollars, with over 70% success rate between 0 to 5000 dolalrs, and over 50% beween 5000 and 15000 dollars, and above 60% of sucess rate between 35000 and 42000 dollars. If set between 15000 and 35000 dollars the success rate fluctuates between 20% and 50%.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

This dataset focuses mainly on the relationship between plays and launch date and campaign outcomes vs goal, yet there are other important campaign methods including television, science fiction, shorts, web, animations, rock and so on, which also contribute to the success rate in the same context but not covered in this dataset.

In addidion, aspects such as campaign country, currency could also affect the analysis and they were also overlooked in this dataset.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

In regard to the limitations mentioned above, we could probably use pivot tables on other campaign methods in conjunction with launch date and goal oriented outcome analysis, and use pie chart/scatter chart to show country impact on campaign success rate, and a line chart to show exchange rate fluctuation's impact on the USD pledged vs target outcome for more accurate analysis.
